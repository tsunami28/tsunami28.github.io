As mentioned, that did not serve our purpose.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was working on an assignment, that at the start seemed like an easy one. We had to redeploy ExpressRoute Circuit which required that we first remove all the connections towards that Circuit. An important thing to mention is that all is done via Azure DevOps release pipelines and that the parameter we had to use is the circuit name.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>Providing good billing overview and reports for customers through CSP is still not fully integrated in either MSP or Azure portal. That&rsquo;s why most providers use 3rd party solutions.
Browsing through one of those for a client I noticed strange reports for a month or two. 
We implemented Azure SQL with Elastic Pool. Great thing with EP is that you pay just for selected DTU and you may create <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/resource-limits-dtu-elastic-pools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;unlimited&rdquo;</a> number of databases. But, if you create a new database and don&rsquo;t add it to the pool, it will be billed separately.</p>]]></description>

<p>Azure team is doing great job with giving us a chance to change more and more options for different services via gui. Application gateway is one of them. But what when you need to implement any kind of automation, IaC ? Here, I still rely on PowerShell.</p>]]></description>

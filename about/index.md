# About Me, Myself and Sky


Welcome Cloud adventurer!

My name is Milos Katinski, from Belgrade, Serbia. I am here to share with you all my hard times and successful findings.

I am an Azure Solutions Engineer with years of experience in the IT industry, with a current
focus on Azure Cloud and DevOps culture. Within years of exploring and working in various
aspects of Azure, I have gained hands-on know-how, which I am
further upgrading working as a Cloud Solution Engineer on various projects.
I am an active blogger and a member of the Azure community with a mission to share
knowledge and further evolve in Azure excellence.
